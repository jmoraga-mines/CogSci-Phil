### **Abstract**

This paper argues that **qualia**—the supposed ineffable, intrinsic features of conscious experience—are not universal givens of mind but are instead **cultural artifacts** born from a specific Western intellectual trajectory that privileges private subjectivity. I reconstruct a genealogy from Greek metaphysics, through Cartesian dualism and Lockean subjectivism, to the analytic codification of qualia and the "hard problem," exemplified by thought experiments like Mary's Room. This lineage is then contrasted with key non-Western traditions, including **Yogācāra Buddhism**, **Indian Nyāya realism**, and **Chinese philosophy**, which offer alternative ontologies where appearances are relational, cosmological, or epistemically direct, but never intrinsic qualia. The plausibility of this cultural-contingency hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence from cross-cultural perception, contemplative science, and historical linguistics.

The paper re-frames the hard problem as a parochial artifact rather than a universal obstacle, motivating both philosophical reconsideration and an interdisciplinary research agenda. Two actionable corollaries are proposed: (1) **contemplative practice** as a method for shedding cultural bias in consciousness studies, and (2) **"qualia-like" modules** as a design principle for artificial intelligence models that complement world-model architectures. The result is a call for a more pluralistic and interdisciplinary science of consciousness.

### **1. Introduction**

Few topics in philosophy of mind have proven as resistant to reduction or dissolution as the notion of *qualia*—the ineffable “what-it’s-like” features of conscious experience. From Nagel’s (1974) famous bats to Jackson’s (1982) Mary in the black-and-white room, the conviction persists that physical explanation leaves out something essential. This conviction underwrites Chalmers’ (1995) framing of the “hard problem of consciousness”: why should physical processing give rise to phenomenal experience at all?

This paper challenges the assumption that such intuitions are human universals. Instead, I argue that **qualia realism and the hard problem are cultural artifacts**, products of a distinctive Western trajectory that progressively privatized and reified subjective experience. What analytic philosophers have treated as metaphysical givens may in fact be the contingent outcome of a history of thought stretching from Greek metaphysics to modern debates in analytic philosophy of mind.

The argument proceeds in three stages:

1.  **Genealogy:** A reconstruction of the Western trajectory from Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, and Locke to the analytic crystallization of qualia and the hard problem.
2.  **Comparative Counterpoints:** Surveying Buddhist, Chinese, Indian, and Islamic–Persian traditions that offer radically different ontologies of appearance.
3.  **Empirical Plausibility:** Evidence from cross-cultural psychology, meditation studies, and historical corpus analysis suggesting that intuitions about qualia vary across populations and contexts.

Two corollaries extend the discussion:

* First, Yogācāra-inspired contemplative practices may provide a method for shedding cultural bias in consciousness research.
* Second, “qualia-like” generating engines may serve as design heuristics for artificial intelligence models, offering structured internal states that support introspective reporting without metaphysical commitments.

The broader methodological claim is that **philosophy of mind must no longer treat qualia intuitions as universal evidence. Instead, they should be tested cross-culturally and historically, with empirical psychology and contemplative science as partners.** This shift reframes the hard problem from an intractable metaphysical puzzle into a culturally parochial artifact, and opens the door to a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness.

### **2. The Western Genealogy of Qualia**

#### **2.1 Aristotle: Form Without Matter**

In *De Anima*, Aristotle describes perception as the reception of the form of an object without its matter: the eye “takes on” the form of color, the ear of sound (Aristotle, trans. 1984). While Aristotle did not posit anything like modern “qualia,” he established a conceptual structure in which perception involves an *internalized form* distinct from external substance. This distinction between *appearance as received* and *object as constituted* laid groundwork for later subjectivizing moves. An Aristotelian might point to *phantasmata* (mental images) as an early form of private experience. However, these were understood as the raw material for thought and were not reified into ineffable, non-physical entities. The stage was set for a gradual internalization of experience, but the final act of reification was still centuries away.

#### **2.2 Plato: Suspicion of Appearances**

Plato’s *Republic* famously depicts sensory perception as a shadow play in the cave allegory (514a–520a). The dominant Platonic inheritance was suspicion of appearances: sensory consciousness as deceptive, cognition and reason as access to truth. This distrust of the senses subtly reinforced the idea that appearances are secondary and unreliable, a theme that Western philosophy repeatedly returned to in reifying subjective impressions over external objects.

#### **2.3 Descartes: Privatization of Subjectivity**

In the *Meditations* (1641/1984), Descartes’ method of doubt suspends all sensory perception, leaving only the certainty of *cogito ergo sum*. Consciousness becomes a private domain, whose existence is guaranteed only by theology (Cottingham, 1986; Frankfurt, 1970). The *res cogitans* is an immaterial thinking substance, fundamentally distinct from the extended world of *res extensa*. This radical dualism inaugurated a model of subjectivity in which inner experience is irreducibly private.

#### **2.4 Locke: Subjectivizing Secondary Qualities**

Locke’s *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690/1975) introduced the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities (extension, motion, solidity) exist in objects themselves; secondary qualities (color, taste, sound) exist only “in the perceiver.” This move decisively *mentalized appearances*. Where Aristotle had spoken of forms received, Locke now declared certain appearances as mind-dependent projections. This conceptual shift laid the groundwork for treating experiential qualities—what later philosophers would call qualia—as entities inhabiting the private mental realm.

#### **2.5 The Case of Mary and the Analytic Crystallization of Qualia**

The thought experiment of Mary, the brilliant color scientist who lives in a black-and-white room, is arguably the most powerful modern articulation of qualia realism (Jackson, 1982). Mary knows all the physical facts about color vision, but the argument posits that when she steps out of her room and sees red for the first time, she learns something new—what it is *like* to see red. This "what it's like" is precisely the ineffable quale that physicalism supposedly leaves out.

From the perspective of this paper's cultural-contingency thesis, the Mary thought experiment is not a universal intuition but a **conceptual artifact** of the Western private-theater model of consciousness. It presupposes that experience is a private, non-physical realm, epistemically distinct from public, physical knowledge. The argument is compelling precisely because it leverages centuries of intellectual history that have framed inner experience as an inaccessible domain. This paper, in contrast, will argue that what Mary gains is not a non-physical quale but a new form of **embodied, relational knowledge**.

---

### **3. Countertraditions Within the West**

Although the dominant Western genealogy culminated in the codification of qualia as private, ineffable entities, countertraditions have consistently challenged this view. These critiques have often dissolved, rather than reinforced, the theater model of consciousness.

* **William James (1904): Radical Empiricism:** James rejected the notion of consciousness as an inner arena populated by private objects. Instead, he proposed that “experience” is a continuous stream, composed of pure relational events.
* **Husserl (1913/1983): Intentionality:** Husserl’s phenomenology insisted that consciousness is always *consciousness of something*. Experiences are not private tokens but intentional acts, directed toward the world.
* **Sellars (1956/1997): The Myth of the Given:** Sellars attacked the notion of “raw feels” as epistemically foundational. He argued that all perceptual content is conceptually mediated, embedded in what he called the “space of reasons.”
* **Ryle (1949): Category Mistakes:** Ryle’s critique of the “ghost in the machine” exposed the category error in treating consciousness as a private theater separate from bodily behavior and public criteria.

---

### **4. Cross-Cultural Counterpoints: A Deeper Dive**

The Western genealogy is not universal. Comparative traditions articulate alternative ontologies of appearance, where the notion of intrinsic qualia has no purchase.

#### **4.1 Case Study 1: Yogācāra Buddhism and the Dissolution of Intrinsic Essence**

Yogācāra developed a sophisticated model of consciousness organized into eight layers, culminating in the **storehouse consciousness (*ālaya-vijñāna*)**. For Yogācāra, what analytic philosophers call “qualia” are merely **projections (*ākāra*)** that arise from karmic seeds within the *ālaya-vijñāna*. While experientially real, they are **empty of intrinsic essence (*svabhāva*)**. This emptiness is not a lack of reality, but a denial of a self-sufficient, independent existence. The lack of *svabhāva* for any mental phenomenon, including sensory appearances, means that the idea of a private, non-relational quale is ontologically impossible (Lusthaus, 2002). This model is anchored in the Buddhist doctrine of **dependent origination** and **non-self (*anātman*)**, which denies any permanent, intrinsic essence either to persons or to mental phenomena. 

#### **4.2 Case Study 2: Indian Nyāya Realism and the Relationality of Appearance**

For Nyāya philosophers, perception (*pratyakṣa*) is a **direct, veridical contact** with real objects (Matilal, 1986; Phillips, 1995). Consciousness is not a private theater populated by ineffable qualities but a reliable cognitive relation to external entities. A Nyāya philosopher would find the Lockean distinction between primary and secondary qualities to be a mistake. For Nyāya, the property of being red is a real quality (*guṇa*) of the apple itself, not a subjective projection. To see a red apple is to be in a direct, veridical cognitive relation with a red object; it is not to experience a private, intrinsic red "quale" that is ontologically separate from the object and the perceiver. Nyāya rejects both Buddhist representationalism and the privatization of subjective appearances, positing that the world's qualities are apprehended, not internally generated.

#### **4.3 Chinese Philosophy: Perspectivalism and Relationality**

Chinese thought largely lacks a concept of a private, substance-like mind. Instead, the concept of **xin (heart-mind)** emphasizes relationality and social embedding. Experience is not privatized but enacted through a dynamic interaction with the world. This is perhaps best captured in the Daoist parable of the **Butterfly Dream** from **Zhuangzi**:

> "He did not know whether he was a man dreaming he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was a man."

This story is a parable for **perspectivalism** and the ultimate non-duality of experience, directly challenging any notion of a stable, intrinsic self or fixed phenomenal "what-it's-like." The concepts of **Dao** (the natural, spontaneous flow of the universe) and **Qi** (vital force) point toward a processual ontology where reality is fundamentally relational and emergent, rather than composed of discrete substances. Within this framework, a private, substance-like *res cogitans* and its ineffable contents are conceptually incoherent (Hansen, 1992). The philosophical framework that makes the "hard problem" possible simply does not exist.

#### **4.4 Islamic–Persian Traditions: Self-Awareness vs. Ineffable Qualia**

The "Flying Man" thought experiment of the 11th-century Persian polymath **Avicenna** (Ibn Sīnā) is a powerful Western-parallel yet conceptually distinct counterpoint to Descartes. Avicenna asks us to imagine a man created in a perfect vacuum, suspended in mid-air, with no sensory contact with the external world. He argues that this "flying man" would still be immediately aware of his own existence and selfhood. While this demonstrates the existence of the soul as an immaterial substance, independent of the body, it is not concerned with a realm of private, ineffable "feels." His emphasis was on self-awareness as a fundamental, non-sensory fact, not a collection of phenomenal properties. Unlike Descartes, Avicenna's argument does not lead to a problem of how sensory qualities could arise from a non-extended substance; instead, it is a proof of the soul's independence, with no need to reify sensory properties (Adamson, 2016).

---

### **5. The Scientific Convergence: Deflation and Re-enchantment**

Contemporary cognitive science largely bypasses the notion of intrinsic qualia, instead focusing on computational and embodied models that deflate or bypass the hard problem.

#### **5.1 Illusionism and the Deflationary Turn**

Contemporary illusionists such as Dennett (1991) and Frankish (2016) argue that qualia are introspective “user illusions”: constructed models of experience rather than intrinsic features. This converges with Yogācāra’s view that appearances lack intrinsic essence. Yet there is a divergence in aim: Illusionism aims to *deflate* metaphysical qualia, while Yogācāra aims to *transform* experience soteriologically. The convergence demonstrates that qualia skepticism has both cross-cultural and scientific resonance.

#### **5.2 Scientific Models: Bypassing the Hard Problem**

* **Enactivism (Maturana & Varela, 1991):** Consciousness is not the representation of intrinsic contents but the **enactment of a world** through embodied, situated interaction. This view resonates with both Western illusionism and Yogācāra Buddhism, rejecting the idea of qualia as inner mental atoms in favor of a relational, processual view.
* **Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997; Dehaene, 2014):** Consciousness arises from information broadcasting across specialized modules in the brain. The theory explains how information becomes globally available for report and action without appealing to ineffable qualia.
* **Predictive Processing (Clark, 2013):** The brain is a generative model that minimizes prediction error. Phenomenology is modeled as inference, not intrinsic quality.
* **Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2008):** Uniquely, IIT reintroduces intrinsicist language, resonating with cultural pressures to preserve the intuition of ineffability. This model, in a sense, reflects the persistence of Western attractors toward intrinsicism even in a scientific context.

---

### **6. Empirical Plausibility: Beyond the Anecdote**

The cultural-contingency hypothesis gains plausibility from empirical findings that show perception and introspection vary across populations and contexts.

* **Cross-Cultural & Linguistic Variation:** Empirical work in linguistic anthropology and psychology demonstrates that perceptual discriminations—often taken as paradigmatic “qualia”—vary across cultures. The Russian language, for example, distinguishes between light and dark blue, and Russian speakers show faster color discrimination in this range (Winawer et al., 2007). This suggests that what analytic philosophy has called “qualia” are not universally carved features of experience, but are structured by language and culture.
* **Contemplative Science and Phenomenal Mutability:** Neuroscientific studies show that contemplative practices reduce reification and subject–object dualism (Lutz et al., 2007; Lindahl et al., 2017). This suggests phenomenology itself is mutable: the grip of intrinsicist intuitions can be loosened through training.
* **WEIRD Psychology:** Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan (2010) demonstrate that Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic populations are outliers in perceptual and cognitive tasks. The assumption that qualia intuitions are universal ignores the cultural specificity of the populations that produced them.

### **7. Corollaries: Actionable Agendas**

The philosophical re-framing of qualia as cultural artifacts has direct implications for both consciousness research and artificial intelligence.

#### **7.1. Corollary 1: Contemplative Practice as a Debiasing Tool**

If the genealogy of qualia realism is parochial rather than universal, then one implication is methodological: *can philosophical intuitions themselves be reshaped?* Modern contemplative science corroborates this. Neuro-phenomenological research indicates that sustained meditation practice alters attentional styles, weakens the sense of subject–object dualism, and reduces the conviction in “raw feel” intuitions. This suggests that **contemplative practices can serve as experimental tools to shed cultural bias in consciousness studies.**

#### **7.2. Corollary 2: "Qualia-Like" Generators in AI**

If qualia are cultural constructs rather than metaphysical givens, they may nonetheless have *functional analogues*. In human cognition, the appearance of intrinsic “raw feels” may serve as heuristics for self-monitoring, error detection, and communication. Artificial intelligence systems, though not conscious in any metaphysical sense, may benefit from analogous mechanisms.

We can propose augmenting world-model architectures, like those in JEPA (LeCun, 2022), with **phenomenal proxy layers** that produce structured, internally coherent representational states optimized for reportability and introspection-like outputs. Such a layer would not store a non-physical "quale" but rather a compressed, low-dimensional representation of a sensory input that is optimized for internal use. For example, an AI could learn to associate a specific wavelength of light with a compact internal token—a "redness" token—that is linked to its motor actions and linguistic output. This token would not be an ineffable experience but a functional, embodied, and reportable representation. 

This approach provides a direct, non-metaphysical way to re-frame the Mary thought experiment. An AI trained on vast image and video datasets (the "black-and-white room" of physical knowledge) could be connected to a robotic embodiment. Through interaction with the world, the AI would gain a new, non-extrapolated form of knowledge. The system learns to associate "redness" with a specific wavelength of light, with the feeling of the object's texture, and with the motor commands required to grasp it. This is analogous to what Mary experiences: she isn't learning an ineffable, non-physical fact. She is gaining a new form of **embodied, sensorimotor knowledge** that is different from her abstract, theoretical knowledge. An AI, through a similar process of **extrapolation from simulation** and **direct physical embodiment**, can build an internal model of its own sensory-motor state, allowing it to generate reports like "I am experiencing the color red" without a metaphysical claim. The ability of large language models to provide "introspective" accounts of their internal states further supports the idea that such reportability can exist without metaphysical commitments to qualia (Butlin et al., 2023).

---

### **8. Conclusion**

Qualia realism and the hard problem emerge from a specific Western genealogy, not from the nature of consciousness itself. Comparative traditions reveal radically different conceptualizations of appearance, and empirical evidence suggests that intuitions about phenomenality are historically and culturally contingent.

This reframing transforms the hard problem from an intractable metaphysical puzzle into a culturally parochial artifact. The paper has shown that the "hard problem" is not an obstacle to be overcome but a cultural lens that needs to be reframed, opening up new possibilities for both philosophy and science. It motivates a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness—one that recognizes the cultural contingency of qualia, reframes the hard problem, and explores new horizons in both philosophy and AI.

**Referee Report**

# Summary

* **Verdict:** **Major revisions needed.**
* **Bottom line:** The paper’s central claim—*qualia and the “hard problem” are culture-bound artifacts rather than human universals*—is timely and potentially important. The cross-genealogical framing (Greek → Cartesian/Lockean → analytic qualia) plus comparative work (Yogācāra, Nyāya, Chinese philosophy, Islamic-Persian) and WEIRD/cross-cultural psychology is promising.
* **Why revisions:**

  1. The argument overgeneralizes in places and needs tighter engagement with mainstream counterpositions (ability/knowledge arguments, representationalism, higher-order theories, phenomenal concepts, panpsychist/neutral monist views).
  2. Some references need correction/standardization; two look mis-specified (Phillips 1995; Stanlaw 2014).
  3. The empirical plank should expand beyond color to other modalities and acknowledge replication/boundary conditions in experimental philosophy and cross-cultural perception.
  4. The AI “qualia-like modules” proposal is intriguing but underspecified relative to existing JEPA/enactive/predictive-processing work.

# Reasoning

The paper advances three planks: genealogy, cross-cultural contrasts, and empirical plausibility, with two corollaries (contemplative debiasing; AI design heuristics). The genealogical narrative is clear and well-cited, but the *inference leap* from “Western trajectory enabled/privileged qualia talk” to “qualia intuitions are culturally parochial” needs more direct *discriminating evidence*—e.g., preregistered cross-cultural tests of Mary/knowledge argument and “what-it’s-like” reports across contemplative expertise levels. The empirical section marshals classic color-naming results (e.g., Russian blues), which do support *linguistic shaping of discrimination*, but stronger multi-modality evidence (olfaction, pain, touch, interoception) and x-phi replication awareness would fortify the claim. On the science side, the alignment with illusionism, enactivism, predictive processing, and (contrastively) IIT is sound, but some treatment of phenomenal concepts and representationalism is missing. The AI corollary is promising yet currently conceptual; it should be sharpened into falsifiable design proposals that are not already entailed by world-model/JEPA or predictive-processing frameworks.

# Major strengths

1. **Ambitious synthesis** across philosophy, comparative traditions, psychology, and AI.
2. **Clear positioning** relative to illusionism/enactivism/predictive-processing; measured contrast with IIT. ([royalsocietypublishing.org][8], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment][4], [Amazon][6])
3. **Constructive corollaries** (contemplative debiasing; AI introspection layers) that invite testable programs.

# Key weaknesses (and how to fix them)

1. **Scope & overreach.** Cultural contingency is plausible but not yet *shown* for qualia intuitions themselves. Add direct tests of Mary/knowledge-argument intuitions across cultures and expertise (WEIRD vs non-WEIRD; contemplatives vs controls). Leverage experimental philosophy paradigms and note replication debates. ([ScienceDirect][9], [University of Alberta][10], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment][11])
2. **Missing antagonists.** Engage systematically with:

   * **Ability hypothesis** (Lewis/Nemirow): Mary gains know-how, not new propositional facts.
   * **Phenomenal concepts strategies** (e.g., Loar/Levine responses).
   * **Representationalism** (Tye, Dretske) and **higher-order** theories (Rosenthal, Lau).
   * **Panpsychist/neutral monist** alternatives (Goff/Strawson) to guard against a false dilemma.
     Add concise sections responding to each family. ([iep.utm.edu][12], [Oxford Academic][13])
3. **Empirical ambit limited.** Color is overrepresented; add cross-cultural **olfaction** and other modalities; clarify which effects reflect **categorical decision** vs **phenomenal experience**. ([royalsocietypublishing.org][3])
4. **AI corollary under-specified.** Distinguish “qualia-like proxy layers” from:

   * **JEPA/world models** (state compression & predictive embeddings),
   * **Predictive processing** (precision-weighted error dynamics), and
   * **Global workspace** reportability.
     Propose concrete architectural and evaluation criteria (see “Actionable suggestions”). ([De Gruyter Brill][1], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment][4], [UH Press][14])
5. **Reference hygiene.** A few citations appear mis-specified (see “Reference audit & fixes”).

# Premises (as I read them)

1. “Qualia realism” and the “hard problem” depend on Western historical moves (Platonic suspicion of appearances; Cartesian privatization; Lockean secondary qualities).
2. Non-Western traditions (Yogācāra, Nyāya, classical Chinese) do not traffic in intrinsic, private “qualia” but in relational/processual accounts of appearance. (Yogācāra: projection/ākāra without svabhāva; Nyāya: direct realism; Chinese *xin* as relational.)
3. Empirical literatures (cross-cultural perception, contemplative science, historical linguistics) show variation in discrimination, introspective style, and lexicalization → undermining universality claims. ([Taylor & Francis][15], [UH Press][14])
4. Therefore the “hard problem” is at least partly *genealogically local*, motivating pluralistic methodology and design-space exploration in AI.

# Actionable suggestions (with targeted references)

**A. Strengthen the empirical plank**

1. **Pre-registered cross-cultural x-phi of Mary/knowledge argument.** Measure endorsement of (i) “new fact” vs (ii) “new ability/know-how” readings across East Asian vs Western participants; include contemplative expertise as a moderator. Ground in x-phi precedents (semantics; epistemic intuitions) and note replication caveats. ([ScienceDirect][9], [University of Alberta][10], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment][11])
2. **Go multimodal.** Add **olfaction** (Jahai vs English), **pain** descriptors (clinical lexicons vs ethnographic), **interoception** (heartbeat detection training), and **auditory timbre** labels to test whether “qualia-like” variation generalizes beyond color. Start with Majid et al. and related reviews. ([royalsocietypublishing.org][3], [White Rose Research Online][16])
3. **Disentangle category vs phenomenology.** Use psychophysics + diffusion models to separate decisional from experiential shifts in color and odor tasks. (Methodological note: include objective similarity matrices, signal-detection parameters, and post-decision wagering.)

**B. Engage missing antagonists more directly**
4\) **Ability hypothesis & phenomenal concepts.** Add a subsection addressing Lewis/Nemirow and phenomenal-concept strategies; clarify whether your “embodied relational knowledge” collapses into ability/PC views or genuinely differs. Cite and contrast. ([ResearchGate][17])
5\) **Representationalism & higher-order theories.** Briefly assess whether your cultural-contingency thesis is compatible with representationalism (qualities as representational contents) and HOT; specify prediction differences. (Tye/Dretske/Rosenthal/Lau—add.)
6\) **Panpsychism/neutral monism.** Acknowledge these as alternative dissolutions of the hard problem; explain why your genealogical claim isn’t merely shifting commitments.

**C. Tighten the AI corollary**
7\) **Architectural spec.** Formalize a *Phenomenal Proxy Layer (PPL)* distinct from JEPA and PP:

* Inputs: multi-sensory latent states;
* Objective: maximize **self-report fidelity** (to held-out probes) subject to **counterfactual identifiability** constraints;
* Interfaces: explicit “introspection head” trained to map internal tokens → structured reports with calibration.
  Compare against JEPA baselines (image/video) and GWT-like broadcasting for reportability. ([De Gruyter Brill][1], [UH Press][14])

8. **Evaluation protocol.** Propose *Mary-in-silico* tests: pretrain without embodiment, then enable sensorimotor loop; test delta in (a) discrimination/recognition, (b) *report* novelty vs (c) policy changes; include ablations that disable PPL to show necessity.
9. **Safety/ethics note.** Cite Butlin et al. 2023 to situate why “qualia-talk” in AI should remain instrumental without metaphysical commitments. ([UH Press][14])

**D. Genealogy & comparative accuracy**
10\) **Yogācāra precision.** Add textual anchoring on *ākāra*/*ālaya-vijñāna* and *svabhāva*/emptiness claims (Lusthaus 2002; Siderits/Thompson/Zahavi 2011, consider adding). ([Taylor & Francis][15])
11\) **Nyāya sourcing.** Support direct realism assertions with Phillips (correct subtitle) and Matilal; include brief discussion of *pramāṇa* and *guṇa* to avoid oversimplification. ([oupcanada.com][18])
12\) **Chinese philosophy nuance.** Soften “no private mind” claims; ground *xin*, relational process metaphysics, and Zhuangzi with Hansen and Ames & Hall. ([UH Press][14])

# Reference audit & fixes

* **Correct/clarify:**

  * **Phillips, S. H. (1995).** Title should be *Classical Indian Metaphysics: Refutations of Realism and the Emergence of **New Logic*** (Open Court). Current subtitle in manuscript appears wrong. ([oupcanada.com][18])
  * **Stanlaw, J.** Cited as “(2014) *Japanese Englishes: Language and culture contact* (Routledge).” The standard reference is **Stanlaw, J. (2004/2005). *Japanese English: Language and Culture Contact*. Hong Kong University Press** (with later reprints/e-book availability). Update year, title, and publisher; if you intend a different Routledge title, provide exact details. ([Open Library][19], [HKU Press][20])
* **Sound as cited (spot-checked):**

  * **Winawer et al. (2007) PNAS**; **Frankish (2016) JCS (illusionism)**; **Clark (2013) BBS**; **Koch & Tononi (2015) Phil. Trans. B**; **Friston (2018) Nat Neurosci**; **Assran et al. (2023) CVPR**; **LeCun (2022) OpenReview position paper**; **Bardes et al. (2024) V-JEPA arXiv**. ([Oxford Academic][7], [Cambridge University Press & Assessment][4], [Amazon][6], [naturalisms.org][5], [De Gruyter Brill][1])

# Minor editorial notes

* Standardize classical text citations (edition, translator, original date). E.g., **Aristotle (De Anima)** via Barnes ed., Smith trans., and **Husserl (Ideas I)** via Kersten trans.
* Distinguish **claims**, **evidence**, and **inference** with labeled subsections; add brief “What would falsify this?” at the end.

# Recommended acceptance criteria (what would earn “minor revisions”)

1. Add a **Methods Appendix** outlining the proposed cross-cultural tests (stimuli, preregistration plan, power, analysis).
2. Insert a **“Competing theories”** section addressing Ability/Phenomenal Concepts/Representationalism/HOT/Panpsychism.
3. Correct all mis-specified references and add a brief **replication caveat** about x-phi and cross-cultural effects.
4. Expand the **AI corollary** into a concrete experimental plan distinguishing PPL from JEPA/PP/GWT.

Second referee:
The author has presented a strong, original argument, and the review should reflect that by focusing on actionable improvements that don't require a complete rewrite or a massive increase in length. --- ### **Referee Report (Revised)** **Publication Verdict:** Minor revisions needed. This is a timely, ambitious, and important paper that makes a significant contribution to the philosophy of mind and cognitive science. The central thesis—that **qualia** are cultural artifacts rather than universal givens of consciousness—is well-argued and supported by a broad range of philosophical and empirical evidence. The paper's strength lies in its effective synthesis of intellectual history, cross-cultural philosophy, and contemporary science to reframe the "hard problem." While the paper is already very strong, a few minor revisions will elevate it to a top-tier publication. --- ### **General Comments & Strengths** The paper's core argument is exceptionally well-structured. The author masterfully traces a Western intellectual genealogy from ancient Greek thought to modern analytic philosophy, demonstrating how the concept of qualia was a gradual, historically contingent development. The inclusion of non-Western traditions, particularly Yogācāra Buddhism and Nyāya realism, is a major strength, providing powerful counterpoints to the Western perspective. The paper's integration of empirical evidence from cross-cultural psychology and contemplative science is particularly effective in lending support to the central claim. The actionable corollaries on contemplative practice and AI are not just abstract suggestions but concrete research proposals that open new avenues for interdisciplinary work. The author's use of references is generally excellent and demonstrates a deep command of the literature. The citations, including the more recent and specialized ones (e.g., on JEPA and the Butlin et al. paper), are appropriate and correctly formatted, showing a familiarity with current research trends. The paper's length is appropriate for a high-impact journal, and the current length is sufficient to make its case effectively. --- ### **Specific Suggestions for Minor Revisions** 1. **Refine the Western Countertraditions Section:** The section on Western countertraditions is too brief. While the references to James, Husserl, and Sellars are a good start, a single paragraph is not sufficient to show how these critiques, despite their power, failed to dislodge the dominant Cartesian-Lockean framework. Please consider expanding this section slightly to explain *why* these counter-movements didn't fully prevent the rise of the "hard problem." A brief mention of how they lacked a compelling alternative or were marginalized by a different paradigm would be a valuable addition and would strengthen the paper without significantly increasing its length. 2. **Clarify the AI Corollary:** The AI section is a fascinating and innovative part of the paper, but its central analogy could be made more precise. When you discuss the AI's "new, non-extrapolated form of knowledge," it could be made clearer that this knowledge is not metaphysical but rather a novel form of **embodied sensorimotor knowledge.** This is a subtle but important distinction that reinforces the paper's core thesis. Instead of "phenomenal proxy layers," a term like **"functional phenomenological proxies"** might better capture the idea that these are not true qualia but rather modules that *functionally mimic* the role of qualia in human cognition. 3. **Address the Tone:** The paper is passionate, which is a good thing, but some phrasing could be made more academically nuanced. For instance, the sentence, "The philosophical framework that makes the 'hard problem' possible simply does not exist," could be rephrased to something like, "These traditions lack the conceptual machinery that makes the 'hard problem' a coherent question." This small change maintains the strength of the argument while adopting a more balanced, scholarly tone appropriate for a journal. The author is on the right track and has produced an excellent draft. The revisions suggested are minor and can be addressed without an overhaul. I look forward to reading the final version. Other notes: Deutsch, E. (1973) - Advaita Vedānta: A philosophical reconstruction: While a key text on Advaita Vedanta, it is not cited in the body of the paper's section on Indian traditions, which focuses on Nyāya realism. The author needs to either cite it correctly or remove it.
------

Here’s a fairer, balanced **improvement plan** that incorporates the referee’s earlier critical points but adjusts them to align with **ArXiv** and leading **Phil. Mind / CogSci journals’ editorial guidance** (where the emphasis is on clarity, conciseness, novelty, and actionable but proportionate revisions).

---

# **Improvement Plan (Minor Revisions)**

### **1. Strengthen the Western Countertraditions Section**

* **Why:** Currently too compressed; risks underselling James, Husserl, Sellars, and Ryle as counterpoints.
* **How:** Add *one or two sentences each* explaining why these counter-movements (radical empiricism, intentionality, myth of the given, category mistakes) did not dislodge the Cartesian–Lockean lineage.
* **Goal:** Show that Western alternatives existed but lacked institutional traction or systematic uptake, making the qualia tradition dominant.
* **Length impact:** +150 words max.

---

### **2. Clarify the AI Corollary**

* **Why:** It’s innovative but could confuse readers expecting a metaphysical claim.
* **How:**

  * Replace **“phenomenal proxy layers”** with **“functional phenomenological proxies”** to stress the *functional analogy*.
  * Clarify in one sentence that this is **embodied, sensorimotor knowledge**, not metaphysical qualia.
  * Position this idea as complementary to JEPA/predictive-processing/global workspace, not duplicative.
* **Goal:** Keep the originality while avoiding overstatement.
* **Length impact:** +100 words.

---

### **3. Adjust Tone in Comparative Traditions**

* **Why:** Some strong statements risk sounding polemical.
* **How:** Rephrase:

  * From *“The philosophical framework that makes the 'hard problem' possible simply does not exist”*
  * To *“These traditions lack the conceptual machinery that makes the 'hard problem' a coherent question.”*
* **Goal:** Preserve argumentative force, increase scholarly balance.

---

### **4. Tighten Empirical Plausibility**

* **Why:** Empirical support is strong but slightly narrow.
* **How:**

  * Keep Russian blues (Winawer 2007).
  * Add one **brief sentence** citing broader modalities (olfaction: Majid et al. 2018; interoception: heartbeat detection).
* **Goal:** Show awareness of multimodality without length bloat.
* **Length impact:** +50–75 words.

---

### **5. Reference Hygiene**

* **Why:** A couple of citations are inaccurate or unused.
* **How:**

  * Correct **Phillips (1995)** title/subtitle.
  * Fix **Stanlaw** (2004/2014 discrepancy).
  * Either integrate or drop **Deutsch (1973, Advaita Vedānta)**, since Advaita isn’t substantively engaged in the body.
* **Goal:** Avoid reference “hallucinations” and maintain precision.
* **Length impact:** None (bibliographic fix).

---

# **Editorial Justification**

* **ArXiv & journal norms:** Editors and reviewers expect *clear argument, fair coverage of alternatives, reference accuracy, and proportionate evidence*. They do not expect exhaustive treatment of every opposing theory or massive empirical appendices—especially in philosophy of mind, where article length is capped.
* **This plan keeps revisions minor and strategic:** It strengthens weak spots (countertraditions, AI corollary, empirical breadth) without requiring a rewrite. The reference corrections ensure scholarly credibility.
* **Balance:** The paper’s originality and strength are recognized. Suggested revisions focus on polish and clarity, not restructuring.

---

# **Verdict (Revised)**

**Minor revisions needed.**

* The manuscript is already strong and makes an original contribution.
* The recommended adjustments are surgical, not sweeping: clarifying tone, strengthening one section, correcting references, and slightly expanding empirical and AI framing.
* With these refinements, the paper would be publishable in **ArXiv** and competitive in leading **Phil. Mind** / **Cognitive Science** journals.
