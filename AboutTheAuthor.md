## Early Interests and Pre-College Formation

From a young age I was drawn to two parallel streams of inquiry: science and engineering, on one hand, and questions of mind, meaning, and consciousness, on the other.

On the scientific side, I cultivated a fascination with computers, electronics, and problem-solving, laying the groundwork for my later training in engineering and artificial intelligence. 
In parallel, I was shaped by early meditation practice—especially Samadhi and Raja Yoga traditions—together with Christian and Buddhist emphases on compassion and love as an all-encompassing lens. Eastern philosophy (Yoga/Vedas, Hindu thought, Daoism, perspectivalism) and Western philosophy (philosophy of science, language, and mind; ethics; Nietzsche’s aesthetics and Übermensch) deepened my sense that human life is both a technical problem and an existential project.

### Religious influence
On the religious side, Christ's/Jewish short statements on foundational principles made empirical sense:
* *Love God above all*: This is in internal test, are our thoughts and foundational priciples aligned with a realized value system where love is the test? This translates on the Christian examples of hate being as much a sin as murder and envy/lust over fornication, and the way we judgde being the ultimate measure of how we will be judged (God as a more perfect view than human ethics)
* *Love neighbor as yourself*: Love must be lived, an also an elevation of the test, even unbelievers love their friends and family, the real test is loving the stranger and the enemy, they are the "neighbor"

Buddhist thought and practice also made sense beyond philosphical complexity or philosophical discussion:
* *Suffering as a consequencce of attachment*: especially the attachment to "self"
* *Dharma through the noble eightfold path*: empirical test of the theory and lived evidence through thought and action

### My synthesis and outlook in life
This dual interest—building intelligent systems while exploring authentic living—would remain the north of my life and career. Even as I acknowledge that my praxis has been short of my ideals.

## College Years and Early Research (1990–1997): Hybrid AI and Vision Systems

During my undergraduate and professional studies in computer engineering, I engaged in a multi-year research program that sought to integrate symbolic AI, neural networks, evolutionary computation, and probabilistic methods.

### Applied Visual Problems

A large part of this work was applied to visual recognition and classification tasks:
* SOMs as a classifier even for idealized sensors
* Biological parallels: Studying how neurological models of vision could inform artificial systems that needed to combine texture, shape, and symbolic reasoning.
* Texture-based symbol recognition: Adapting methods from optical character recognition to analyze industrial textures (e.g. images from drill cores in mining exploration).
* Mining and geoscience: Developing systems for classification and sizing of minerals in core samples, combining expert-rule reasoning with deep neural networks inspired by the Neocognitron, one of the earliest biologically motivated vision models.

### Hybrid and Optimization Methods

To address these problems, I tested and combined a range of paradigms:
* Expert systems + neural networks for blending explicit rules with pattern recognition.
* Genetic algorithms and simulated annealing for optimization of parameters (e.g. neural network hyperparameters) and architectures (pruning, ablation).
* Symbolic approaches (Lisp, Prolog) for representation and inference.
* Multilayer perceptrons and deep networks for nonlinear function approximation and texture classification.

### Use of Probabilistic Data Science and Engineering Control

I explored Bayesian methods and Markovian models to manage uncertainty and sequential processes, and studied industrial control and singularities (linear, plynomial, integrative and derivative controllers). 

### Conceptual Integration

The 1996 professional thesis (Discusión, taxonomía y estado del arte de los sistemas híbridos en inteligencia artificial) synthesized these efforts into a taxonomy and state of the art of hybrid AI systems. Importantly, it was not just a technical catalogue: it explicitly connected AI to biology (enactivism and embodiment), psychology (multiple intelligences, g-factor), and philosophy of mind.

Its core argument was forward-looking: embodiment must be acknowledged as central for human-like or biologically plausible intelligence. This position, advanced in the mid-1990s, anticipated later trends in embodied cognition, enactivist AI, and multimodal learning.

## Post-College Reflection and Self-Study (1997–2018)

After completing my early research, I entered a two-decade period of reflection, self-study, and personal exploration. While less oriented toward publication, this phase was essential for deepening the philosophical and humanistic foundations of my later work.
*	I immersed myself in philosophy of language, philosophy of mind, and psychology, tracking developments in AI while critically examining their assumptions.
*	Personal challenges—including neurodivergence and depression—shaped a stoic and existential outlook and inspired sustained engagement with compassion-centered living.
* I studied comparative religion and philosophy, synthesizing insights from Western traditions of rational inquiry and authenticity with Eastern traditions of meditation, interconnectedness, and perspectivalism.

This period reinforced my conviction that any credible account of intelligence, whether human or artificial, must grapple not only with computation but also with experience, embodiment, and meaning.

## Return to Applied AI and Research (2018–Present)

Early in my doctoral studies I developed an architecture for multimodal computer vision used for ecological analysis. This was supported by my early intuitions of the 90's, and additional study in 2D, 3d, hyperspectral and multimodal models. 

### Doctoral Research in Geoscience AI

I returned to formal research with a PhD in Earth Resources Development Engineering at the Colorado School of Mines. My dissertation focused on AI for early-stage geothermal exploration, integrating satellite, hyperspectral, infrared, and geophysical data to improve resource discovery (Moraga, 2022a). This work expanded my expertise in multimodal architectures and machine learning pipelines.

### Contributions to Hyperspectral Vision

I developed JigsawHSI, a novel neural network for hyperspectral image classification (Moraga, 2022b). This contribution aligned my earlier interests in vision and pattern recognition with modern deep learning, bringing probabilistic and multimodal insights into contemporary application domains.

### Philosophy of Mind and AI Integration

Most recently, I have returned to the intersection of AI and philosophy of mind, now reframed with decades of reflection. My current work challenges the universality of the “hard problem” of consciousness, proposing that qualia and intrinsicist views are culturally contingent artifacts of Western thought.

As an alternative, I propose Functional Phenomenological Proxies (FPPs): AI modules that enable structured self-reporting of internal states without metaphysical commitments. This proposal is both philosophical and technical, bridging comparative philosophy, contemplative practice, and the engineering of interpretable AI architectures.

## Conclusion: A Lifelong Integration

From pre-college meditation practice to 1990s hybrid AI systems, from two decades of philosophical self-study to cutting-edge applied AI and philosophy of mind, my research journey has been defined by one throughline: the integration of technical innovation with existential and humanistic depth.

Whether classifying minerals in geological cores, designing hyperspectral networks, or reframing qualia in light of cultural history, the guiding question has been constant: How can intelligence—human or artificial—be understood in ways that are both scientifically rigorous and humanly meaningful?
