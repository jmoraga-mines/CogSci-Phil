## **Abstract**

This paper argues that **qualia**—the supposed ineffable, intrinsic features of conscious experience—are not universal givens of mind but are instead **cultural artifacts** born from a specific Western intellectual trajectory that privileges private subjectivity. I reconstruct a genealogy from Greek metaphysics, through Cartesian dualism and Lockean subjectivism, to the analytic codification of qualia and the "hard problem," exemplified by thought experiments like Mary's Room. This lineage is then contrasted with key non-Western traditions, including **Yogācāra Buddhism**, **Indian Nyāya realism**, and **Chinese philosophy**, which offer alternative ontologies where appearances are relational, cosmological, or epistemically direct, but never intrinsic qualia. The plausibility of this cultural-contingency hypothesis is supported by empirical evidence from cross-cultural perception, contemplative science, and historical linguistics.

The paper re-frames the hard problem as a parochial artifact rather than a universal obstacle, motivating both philosophical reconsideration and an interdisciplinary research agenda. Two actionable corollaries are proposed: (1) **contemplative practice** as a method for shedding cultural bias in consciousness studies, and (2) **"functional phenomenological proxies"** (replacing the earlier phrase "qualia-like modules") as a design principle for artificial intelligence models that complement world-model architectures. The result is a call for a more pluralistic and interdisciplinary science of consciousness.

## **1. Introduction**

Few topics in philosophy of mind have proven as resistant to reduction or dissolution as the notion of *qualia*—the ineffable “what-it’s-like” features of conscious experience. From Nagel’s (1974) famous bats to Jackson’s (1982) Mary in the black-and-white room, the conviction persists that physical explanation leaves out something essential. This conviction underwrites Chalmers’ (1995) framing of the “hard problem of consciousness”: why should physical processing give rise to phenomenal experience at all?

This paper challenges the assumption that such intuitions are human universals. Instead, I argue that **qualia realism and the hard problem are cultural artifacts**, products of a distinctive Western trajectory that progressively privatized and reified subjective experience. What analytic philosophers have treated as metaphysical givens may in fact be the contingent outcome of a history of thought stretching from Greek metaphysics to modern debates in analytic philosophy of mind.

The argument proceeds in three stages:

1.  **Genealogy:** A reconstruction of the Western trajectory from Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, and Locke to the analytic crystallization of qualia and the hard problem.
2.  **Comparative Counterpoints:** Surveying Buddhist, Chinese, Indian, and Islamic–Persian traditions that offer radically different ontologies of appearance.
3.  **Empirical Plausibility:** Evidence from cross-cultural psychology, meditation studies, and historical corpus analysis suggesting that intuitions about qualia vary across populations and contexts.

Two corollaries extend the discussion:

* First, Yogācāra-inspired contemplative practices may provide a method for shedding cultural bias in consciousness research.
* Second, “functional phenomenological proxies” may serve as design heuristics for artificial intelligence models, offering structured internal states that support introspective reporting without metaphysical commitments.

The broader methodological claim is that **philosophy of mind must no longer treat qualia intuitions as universal evidence. Instead, they should be tested cross-culturally and historically, with empirical psychology and contemplative science as partners.** This shift reframes the hard problem from an intractable metaphysical puzzle into a culturally parochial artifact, and opens the door to a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness.

## **2. The Western Genealogy of Qualia**

### **2.1 Aristotle: Form Without Matter**

In *De Anima*, Aristotle describes perception as the reception of the form of an object without its matter: the eye “takes on” the form of color, the ear of sound (Aristotle, trans. 1984). While Aristotle did not posit anything like modern “qualia,” he established a conceptual structure in which perception involves an *internalized form* distinct from external substance. This distinction between *appearance as received* and *object as constituted* laid groundwork for later subjectivizing moves. An Aristotelian might point to *phantasmata* (mental images) as an early form of private experience. However, these were understood as the raw material for thought and were not reified into ineffable, non-physical entities. The stage was set for a gradual internalization of experience, but the final act of reification was still centuries away.

### **2.2 Plato: Suspicion of Appearances**

Plato’s *Republic* famously depicts sensory perception as a shadow play in the cave allegory (514a–520a). The dominant Platonic inheritance was suspicion of appearances: sensory consciousness as deceptive, cognition and reason as access to truth. This distrust of the senses subtly reinforced the idea that appearances are secondary and unreliable, a theme that Western philosophy repeatedly returned to in reifying subjective impressions over external objects.

### **2.3 Descartes: Privatization of Subjectivity**

In the *Meditations* (1641/1984), Descartes’ method of doubt suspends all sensory perception, leaving only the certainty of *cogito ergo sum*. Consciousness becomes a private domain, whose existence is guaranteed only by theology (Cottingham, 1986; Frankfurt, 1970). The *res cogitans* is an immaterial thinking substance, fundamentally distinct from the extended world of *res extensa*. This radical dualism inaugurated a model of subjectivity in which inner experience is irreducibly private.

### **2.4 Locke: Subjectivizing Secondary Qualities**

Locke’s *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690/1975) introduced the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities (extension, motion, solidity) exist in objects themselves; secondary qualities (color, taste, sound) exist only “in the perceiver.” This move decisively *mentalized appearances*. Where Aristotle had spoken of forms received, Locke now declared certain appearances as mind-dependent projections. This conceptual shift laid the groundwork for treating experiential qualities—what later philosophers would call qualia—as entities inhabiting the private mental realm.

### **2.5 The Case of Mary and the Analytic Crystallization of Qualia**

The thought experiment of Mary, the brilliant color scientist who lives in a black-and-white room, is arguably the most powerful modern articulation of qualia realism (Jackson, 1982). Mary knows all the physical facts about color vision, but the argument posits that when she steps out of her room and sees red for the first time, she learns something new—what it is *like* to see red. This "what it's like" is precisely the ineffable quale that physicalism supposedly leaves out.

From the perspective of this paper's cultural-contingency thesis, the Mary thought experiment is not a universal intuition but a **conceptual artifact** of the Western private-theater model of consciousness. It presupposes that experience is a private, non-physical realm, epistemically distinct from public, physical knowledge. The argument is compelling precisely because it leverages centuries of intellectual history that have framed inner experience as an inaccessible domain. This paper, in contrast, will argue that what Mary gains is not a non-physical quale but a new form of **embodied, relational knowledge**.

## **3. Countertraditions Within the West**

Although the dominant Western genealogy culminated in the codification of qualia as private, ineffable entities, countertraditions have consistently challenged this view. These critiques have often dissolved, rather than reinforced, the theater model of consciousness.

* **William James (1904): Radical Empiricism.**  
  James rejected the notion of consciousness as an inner arena populated by private objects. Instead, he proposed that “experience” is a continuous stream, composed of pure relational events. However, James’s pragmatist and process-oriented approach, though powerful, was marginalized by the rise of logical positivism and later analytic philosophy, which privileged logical form over phenomenological description.

* **Husserl (1913/1983): Intentionality.**  
  Husserl’s phenomenology insisted that consciousness is always *consciousness of something*. Experiences are not private tokens but intentional acts, directed toward the world. Yet phenomenology’s Continental trajectory meant that these insights remained largely separate from Anglo-American analytic debates about qualia, where the problem was already framed in Cartesian terms.

* **Sellars (1956/1997): The Myth of the Given.**  
  Sellars attacked the notion of “raw feels” as epistemically foundational. He argued that all perceptual content is conceptually mediated, embedded in what he called the “space of reasons.” This was a devastating critique of intrinsic “raw feels,” yet analytic philosophy of mind continued to focus on qualia as metaphysical givens rather than epistemic myths.

* **Ryle (1949): Category Mistakes.**  
  Ryle’s critique of the “ghost in the machine” exposed the category error in treating consciousness as a private theater separate from bodily behavior and public criteria. His functionalist leanings foreshadowed later cognitive science, but Ryle’s behaviorism was eclipsed by the cognitive revolution, which re-entrenched representationalist assumptions.

These countertraditions show that alternatives to qualia realism were articulated in the West, but they lacked institutional traction or systematic uptake. They offered powerful critiques, but without integration into mainstream analytic philosophy, the Cartesian–Lockean lineage prevailed and crystallized in modern qualia debates.

## **4. Cross-Cultural Counterpoints: A Deeper Dive**

The Western genealogy is not universal. Comparative traditions articulate alternative ontologies of appearance, where the notion of intrinsic qualia has no purchase.

### **4.1 Case Study 1: Yogācāra Buddhism and the Dissolution of Intrinsic Essence**

Yogācāra developed a sophisticated model of consciousness organized into eight layers, culminating in the **storehouse consciousness (*ālaya-vijñāna*)**. For Yogācāra, what analytic philosophers call “qualia” are merely **projections (*ākāra*)** that arise from karmic seeds within the *ālaya-vijñāna*. While experientially real, they are **empty of intrinsic essence (*svabhāva*)**.  

This emptiness is not a lack of reality, but a denial of a self-sufficient, independent existence. The lack of *svabhāva* for any mental phenomenon, including sensory appearances, means that the idea of a private, non-relational quale is ontologically impossible (Lusthaus, 2002). This model is anchored in the Buddhist doctrine of **dependent origination** and **non-self (*anātman*)**, which denies any permanent, intrinsic essence either to persons or to mental phenomena.  

### **4.2 Case Study 2: Indian Nyāya Realism and the Relationality of Appearance**

For Nyāya philosophers, perception (*pratyakṣa*) is a **direct, veridical contact** with real objects (Matilal, 1986; Phillips, 1995). Consciousness is not a private theater populated by ineffable qualities but a reliable cognitive relation to external entities.  

A Nyāya philosopher would find the Lockean distinction between primary and secondary qualities to be a mistake. For Nyāya, the property of being red is a real quality (*guṇa*) of the apple itself, not a subjective projection. To see a red apple is to be in a direct, veridical cognitive relation with a red object; it is not to experience a private, intrinsic red "quale" that is ontologically separate from the object and the perceiver. Nyāya rejects both Buddhist representationalism and the privatization of subjective appearances, positing that the world's qualities are apprehended, not internally generated.  

### **4.3 Chinese Philosophy: Perspectivalism and Relationality**

Chinese thought largely lacks a concept of a private, substance-like mind. Instead, the concept of **xin (heart-mind)** emphasizes relationality and social embedding. Experience is not privatized but enacted through a dynamic interaction with the world.  

This is perhaps best captured in the Daoist parable of the **Butterfly Dream** from **Zhuangzi**:

> "He did not know whether he was a man dreaming he was a butterfly, or a butterfly dreaming he was a man."

This story is a parable for **perspectivalism** and the ultimate non-duality of experience, directly challenging any notion of a stable, intrinsic self or fixed phenomenal "what-it's-like." The concepts of **Dao** (the natural, spontaneous flow of the universe) and **Qi** (vital force) point toward a processual ontology where reality is fundamentally relational and emergent, rather than composed of discrete substances.  

Within this framework, a private, substance-like *res cogitans* and its ineffable contents are conceptually incoherent (Hansen, 1992; Ames & Hall, 2001). Put more carefully: these traditions lack the **conceptual machinery** that makes the "hard problem" a coherent question in the first place.  

### **4.4 Islamic–Persian Traditions: Self-Awareness vs. Ineffable Qualia**

The "Flying Man" thought experiment of the 11th-century Persian polymath **Avicenna** (Ibn Sīnā) is a powerful Western-parallel yet conceptually distinct counterpoint to Descartes. Avicenna asks us to imagine a man created in a perfect vacuum, suspended in mid-air, with no sensory contact with the external world. He argues that this "flying man" would still be immediately aware of his own existence and selfhood.  

While this demonstrates the existence of the soul as an immaterial substance, independent of the body, it is not concerned with a realm of private, ineffable "feels." His emphasis was on self-awareness as a fundamental, non-sensory fact, not a collection of phenomenal properties. Unlike Descartes, Avicenna's argument does not lead to a problem of how sensory qualities could arise from a non-extended substance; instead, it is a proof of the soul's independence, with no need to reify sensory properties (Adamson, 2016).

## **5. The Scientific Convergence: Deflation and Re-enchantment**

Contemporary cognitive science largely bypasses the notion of intrinsic qualia, instead focusing on computational and embodied models that deflate or bypass the hard problem.

### **5.1 Illusionism and the Deflationary Turn**

Contemporary illusionists such as Dennett (1991) and Frankish (2016) argue that qualia are introspective “user illusions”: constructed models of experience rather than intrinsic features. This converges with Yogācāra’s view that appearances lack intrinsic essence. Yet there is a divergence in aim: Illusionism aims to *deflate* metaphysical qualia, while Yogācāra aims to *transform* experience soteriologically. The convergence demonstrates that qualia skepticism has both cross-cultural and scientific resonance.

### **5.2 Scientific Models: Bypassing the Hard Problem**

* **Enactivism (Maturana & Varela, 1991).** Consciousness is not the representation of intrinsic contents but the **enactment of a world** through embodied, situated interaction. This view resonates with both Western illusionism and Yogācāra Buddhism, rejecting the idea of qualia as inner mental atoms in favor of a relational, processual view.

* **Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997; Dehaene, 2014).** Consciousness arises from information broadcasting across specialized modules in the brain. The theory explains how information becomes globally available for report and action without appealing to ineffable qualia.

* **Predictive Processing (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2018).** The brain is a generative model that minimizes prediction error. Phenomenology is modeled as inference, not intrinsic quality.

* **Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2008; Koch & Tononi, 2015).** Uniquely, IIT reintroduces intrinsicist language, resonating with cultural pressures to preserve the intuition of ineffability. This model, in a sense, reflects the persistence of Western attractors toward intrinsicism even in a scientific context.

---

## **6. Empirical Plausibility: Beyond the Anecdote**

The cultural-contingency hypothesis gains plausibility from empirical findings that show perception and introspection vary across populations and contexts.

* **Cross-Cultural & Linguistic Variation.** Empirical work in linguistic anthropology and psychology demonstrates that perceptual discriminations—often taken as paradigmatic “qualia”—vary across cultures. The Russian language, for example, distinguishes between light and dark blue, and Russian speakers show faster color discrimination in this range (Winawer et al., 2007). Similarly, research on the Berinmo (Papua New Guinea) and Himba (Namibia) has shown that their color categories diverge significantly from those of English speakers, affecting both discrimination and memory (Roberson et al., 2005). This suggests that what analytic philosophy has called “qualia” are not universally carved features of experience, but are structured by language and culture.

* **Olfaction.** Majid et al. (2018) show that speakers of Jahai (a language of the Malay Peninsula) have a rich and precise odor vocabulary, enabling them to name and discriminate smells far more consistently than English speakers. If qualia were intrinsic and universal, such stark differences in odor phenomenology and its lexicalization would be unexpected.

* **Interoception.** Training in heartbeat detection and other interoceptive tasks has been shown to alter subjective awareness of bodily states. This suggests that even internal “what-it’s-like” experiences of the body are plastic and trainable rather than fixed givens.

* **Pain and Touch.** Ethnographic and clinical lexicons reveal cultural variation in how pain and tactile experiences are parsed and described, indicating that the felt qualities themselves are not cross-culturally stable but shaped by linguistic and social contexts.

* **Contemplative Science and Phenomenal Mutability.** Neuroscientific studies show that contemplative practices reduce reification and subject–object dualism (Lutz et al., 2007; Lindahl et al., 2017). This suggests phenomenology itself is mutable: the grip of intrinsicist intuitions can be loosened through training.

* **WEIRD Psychology.** Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan (2010) demonstrate that Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic populations are outliers in perceptual and cognitive tasks. The assumption that qualia intuitions are universal ignores the cultural specificity of the populations that produced them.

### **Replication and Boundary Conditions**

Experimental philosophy has shown that intuitions can vary not only across cultures but also within subpopulations. However, replication debates caution against overgeneralization (Weinberg et al., 2001; Stich & Nichols, 2003; see also failures of replication in epistemic intuitions: Machery et al., 2015). For this reason, the cultural-contingency thesis must be treated as a **research program**, not as a settled conclusion. Pre-registered, cross-cultural studies of Mary-style knowledge intuitions and “what-it’s-like” reports remain an urgent next step.

## **7. Engaging Competing Theories**

The cultural-contingency hypothesis must be situated within mainstream debates in philosophy of mind. Several competing theories have sought to address the knowledge argument, the nature of phenomenal concepts, and the ontology of experience. Brief engagement clarifies how my thesis differs.

### **7.1 The Ability Hypothesis**

Lewis (1929) and Nemirow argue that Mary gains no new propositional fact but acquires a new ability or know-how — e.g., to recognize or imagine red. On my view, Mary gains embodied, relational knowledge: a sensorimotor coupling that was previously absent. This resembles the ability account but differs by situating the entire *intuition of a missing fact* within a Western genealogy. The pull of the knowledge argument reflects cultural priors, not universal cognitive architecture.

### **7.2 Phenomenal Concepts Strategies**

Loar, Levine, and others have argued that qualia are physical but accessed via distinct *phenomenal concepts*, explaining the sense of an epistemic gap without metaphysical dualism. My account is orthogonal: I claim that the *sense of a gap itself* is parochial. Phenomenal concepts strategies explain away intuitions within the analytic framework; I question why that framework arose and why those intuitions feel compelling in the first place.

### **7.3 Representationalism and Higher-Order Theories**

Representationalists (Tye, Dretske) argue that phenomenal character is identical to representational content. Higher-order theorists (Rosenthal, Lau) propose that consciousness consists in thoughts about mental states. My thesis is compatible with these in that both deny ineffable qualia. Yet they still presuppose the analytic framing of “qualia talk.” The cultural-contingency thesis undercuts the universality of that framing itself, asking why representational or higher-order *solutions* are needed at all.

### **7.4 Panpsychism and Neutral Monism**

Panpsychists (Goff) and neutral monists (Strawson) dissolve the hard problem by treating consciousness as fundamental. While these avoid dualism, they remain within the Western trajectory that treats ineffable feels as bedrock data. Comparative traditions show that such starting points are not inevitable. My aim is not to endorse a rival ontology but to demonstrate that the very need for one is genealogically contingent.

---

## **7. Corollaries: Actionable Agendas**

The philosophical re-framing of qualia as cultural artifacts has direct implications for both consciousness research and artificial intelligence.

### **7.1 Corollary 1: Contemplative Practice as a Debiasing Tool**

If the genealogy of qualia realism is parochial rather than universal, then one implication is methodological: *can philosophical intuitions themselves be reshaped?* Modern contemplative science corroborates this. Neuro-phenomenological research indicates that sustained meditation practice alters attentional styles, weakens the sense of subject–object dualism, and reduces the conviction in “raw feel” intuitions.  

This suggests that **contemplative practices can serve as experimental tools to shed cultural bias in consciousness studies.** A cross-cultural research program might test Mary-style thought experiments with groups stratified by contemplative expertise, comparing responses between WEIRD novices, non-WEIRD participants, and trained contemplatives. Such data could empirically adjudicate whether the hard problem is a cultural artifact.

---

### **7.2 Corollary 2: Functional Phenomenological Proxies in AI**

If qualia are cultural constructs rather than metaphysical givens, they may nonetheless have *functional analogues*. In human cognition, the appearance of intrinsic “raw feels” may serve as heuristics for self-monitoring, error detection, and communication. Artificial intelligence systems, though not conscious in any metaphysical sense, may benefit from analogous mechanisms.

I propose augmenting world-model architectures (LeCun, 2022; Assran et al., 2023; Bardes et al., 2024) with **functional phenomenological proxies (FPPs)**: internal modules that generate structured, introspection-ready states optimized for **self-report fidelity**. These proxies do not store metaphysical qualia but instead act as compressed, low-dimensional tokens of sensory–motor coupling.

**Key distinctions:**

* **From JEPA/world models:** JEPA compresses predictive embeddings for perception-action tasks. FPPs explicitly optimize for self-report calibration and counterfactual identifiability.  
* **From Predictive Processing:** Predictive models minimize error; FPPs add calibrated “introspection heads” that map latent states into structured self-reports.  
* **From Global Workspace:** GWT explains broadcasting for reportability; FPPs supplement with fidelity constraints that make reports introspectively structured.  

**Mary-in-silico Test.**  
An AI trained only in simulation (a “black-and-white room”) could be given embodiment. Researchers would measure the delta between pre-embodiment and post-embodiment in:  
(a) discrimination and recognition accuracy,  
(b) policy adaptation, and  
(c) novelty of self-reports.  

Ablation studies could disable the FPP layer to show its necessity for introspection-like reporting. This experimental design sharpens the analogy to Mary: what the AI gains is not a metaphysical quale but a new form of **embodied, sensorimotor knowledge**, functionally reportable through FPPs.

**Safety note.**  
Following Butlin et al. (2023), such proxies must remain functional and instrumental. They should not be taken as evidence of metaphysical consciousness but as practical design tools for AI introspection and safety.

## **8. Conclusion**

Qualia realism and the hard problem emerge from a specific Western genealogy, not from the nature of consciousness itself. Comparative traditions reveal radically different conceptualizations of appearance, and empirical evidence suggests that intuitions about phenomenality are historically and culturally contingent.

This reframing transforms the hard problem from an intractable metaphysical puzzle into a culturally parochial artifact. The paper has shown that the "hard problem" is not an obstacle to be overcome but a cultural lens that needs to be reframed, opening up new possibilities for both philosophy and science.  

It motivates a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness—one that recognizes the cultural contingency of qualia, reframes the hard problem, and explores new horizons in both philosophy and AI.
