## Abstract

This paper argues that *qualia*—the supposed ineffable, intrinsic features of conscious experience—are not universal givens of mind but cultural products of a Western trajectory that privileges private subjectivity. I reconstruct a genealogy from Aristotle’s “form without matter,” through Plato’s suspicion of appearances, Descartes’ *res cogitans*, and Locke’s subjectivizing of secondary qualities, culminating in the analytic codification of qualia and the “hard problem.” Countertraditions within the West (James, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Sellars, Ryle) sought to dissolve the private-theater model, yet never displaced its dominance.

Placing this lineage in comparative perspective, I show how Yogācāra Buddhism, Chinese conceptions of *xin* and perspectivalism, Indian Nyāya and Advaita accounts, and Islamic–Persian traditions (Avicenna, Suhrawardī) articulate alternative ontologies in which appearances are relational, cosmological, or soteriological, but never intrinsic qualia. Scientific theories largely deflate qualia (global workspace, predictive processing, enactivism), though illusionism and Yogācāra converge in denying intrinsic essence for divergent aims, while Integrated Information Theory reintroduces intrinsicist vocabulary under cultural pressure.

Empirical footholds from cross-cultural perception, WEIRD psychology, meditation studies, and historical corpus analysis support the plausibility—but not the demonstration—of a cultural-contingency hypothesis. Two further research avenues are proposed: (1) Yogācāra-inspired contemplative training as a method for shedding cultural bias in consciousness studies, and (2) “qualia-like” generating modules as a design principle for artificial intelligence models that complement world-model architectures.

The result reframes the hard problem as a parochial artifact rather than a universal obstacle, motivating both philosophical reconsideration and an interdisciplinary research agenda.

## 1. Introduction

Few topics in philosophy of mind have proven as resistant to reduction or dissolution as the notion of *qualia*—the ineffable “what-it’s-like” features of conscious experience. From Nagel’s (1974) famous bats to Jackson’s (1982) Mary in the black-and-white room, the conviction persists that physical explanation leaves out something essential. This conviction underwrites Chalmers’ (1995) framing of the “hard problem of consciousness”: why should physical processing give rise to phenomenal experience at all?

This paper challenges the assumption that such intuitions are human universals. Instead, I argue that **qualia realism and the hard problem are cultural artifacts**, products of a distinctive Western trajectory that progressively privatized and reified subjective experience. What analytic philosophers have treated as metaphysical givens may in fact be the contingent outcome of a history of thought stretching from Greek metaphysics to modern debates in analytic philosophy of mind.

The argument proceeds in three stages:

1. **Genealogy:** A reconstruction of the Western trajectory from Aristotle, Plato, Descartes, and Locke to the analytic crystallization of qualia and the hard problem.
2. **Comparative Counterpoints:** Surveying Buddhist, Chinese, Indian, and Islamic–Persian traditions that offer radically different ontologies of appearance.
3. **Empirical Plausibility:** Evidence from cross-cultural psychology, meditation studies, and historical corpus analysis suggesting that intuitions about qualia vary across populations and contexts.

Two corollaries extend the discussion:

* First, Yogācāra-inspired contemplative practices may provide a method for shedding cultural bias in consciousness research.
* Second, “qualia-like” generating engines may serve as design heuristics for artificial intelligence models, offering structured internal states that support introspective reporting without metaphysical commitments.

The broader methodological claim is that **philosophy of mind must no longer treat qualia intuitions as universal evidence. Instead, they should be tested cross-culturally and historically, with empirical psychology and contemplative science as partners.** This shift reframes the hard problem from an intractable metaphysical puzzle into a culturally parochial artifact, and opens the door to a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness.

## 2. The Western Genealogy of Qualia

### 2.1 Aristotle: Form Without Matter

In *De Anima*, Aristotle describes perception as the reception of the form of an object without its matter: the eye “takes on” the form of color, the ear of sound (Aristotle, trans. 1984). This model has been interpreted divergently—Sorabji (1974) reads it as a form of naïve realism, whereas Johansen (1997) emphasizes proto-representationalist aspects.

Although Aristotle did not posit anything like modern “qualia,” he established a conceptual structure in which perception involves an *internalized form* distinct from external substance. This distinction between *appearance as received* and *object as constituted* laid groundwork for later subjectivizing moves. The stage was set for a gradual internalization of experience.

---

### 2.2 Plato: Suspicion of Appearances

Plato’s *Republic* famously depicts sensory perception as a shadow play in the cave allegory (514a–520a). While later dialogues such as the *Timaeus* grant perception a constructive role, the dominant Platonic inheritance was suspicion of appearances: sensory consciousness as deceptive, cognition and reason as access to truth.

This distrust of the senses subtly reinforced the idea that appearances are secondary and unreliable, a theme that Western philosophy repeatedly returned to in reifying subjective impressions over external objects. Plato thus inaugurated a tension between *appearance* and *reality* that future theories of consciousness would recast in increasingly internal terms.

---

### 2.3 Descartes: Privatization of Subjectivity

In the *Meditations* (1641/1984), Descartes’ method of doubt suspends all sensory perception, leaving only the certainty of *cogito ergo sum*. Consciousness becomes a private domain, whose existence is guaranteed only by theology (Cottingham, 1986; Frankfurt, 1970). The *res cogitans* is an immaterial thinking substance, fundamentally distinct from the extended world of *res extensa*.

This radical dualism inaugurated a model of subjectivity in which inner experience is irreducibly private, epistemically secure yet ontologically detached. The Cartesian move decisively reified the idea of consciousness as a private theater, accessible only to the subject, and paved the way for modern qualia discourse.

---

### 2.4 Locke: Subjectivizing Secondary Qualities

Locke’s *Essay Concerning Human Understanding* (1690/1975) introduced the distinction between primary and secondary qualities. Primary qualities (extension, motion, solidity) exist in objects themselves; secondary qualities (color, taste, sound) exist only “in the perceiver.”

This move decisively *mentalized appearances*. Where Aristotle had spoken of forms received, Locke now declared certain appearances as mind-dependent projections. This conceptual shift laid the groundwork for treating experiential qualities—what later philosophers would call qualia—as entities inhabiting the private mental realm rather than the shared world.

---

### 2.5 Analytic Crystallization: From Lewis to Chalmers

The 20th century analytic tradition codified these trends. Lewis (1929) introduced the term “qualia” to denote subjective qualities of experience. Jackson (1982) advanced the knowledge argument, insisting that physicalist accounts omit something essential. Chalmers (1995) crystallized this trajectory in his articulation of the “hard problem of consciousness.”

Qualia were now rendered as private, ineffable, and intrinsic properties of experience. This formulation institutionalized the explanatory gap, embedding within analytic philosophy a model of consciousness as fundamentally resistant to reduction.

---

### 2.6 Contemporary Qualia Realism: Block, Kriegel, Chalmers

Even after decades of critique, contemporary philosophy of mind continues to reify qualia.

* **Block (1995)** distinguishes *phenomenal consciousness* (the raw feel of experience) from *access consciousness* (information availability for reasoning and report). Block insists phenomenal consciousness is a distinct, irreducible category. Yet from a cultural-contingency perspective, this move presupposes the universality of “raw feel” as a datum—precisely what is here contested.
* **Kriegel (2009)** advances a self-representational theory of consciousness: each conscious state represents itself in addition to its object. This promises a naturalistic model, but again assumes the universality of phenomenal givenness.
* **Chalmers (1996, 2010)** develops naturalistic dualism, arguing that phenomenal consciousness resists physical explanation and may require psychophysical bridging principles. Here too, the hard problem is treated as a timeless given rather than a cultural construction.

From the perspective advanced in this paper, all three approaches exemplify the persistence of a Western inheritance: *phenomenal qualities are taken as universal, immediate, and intrinsic*. Yet if the very intuition of intrinsic phenomenal properties is culturally contingent, then these sophisticated models are reifying what other traditions and empirical evidence suggest is constructed.

---
Alright — here’s **Part II of the rewritten ArXiv master paper** in one continuous block. It integrates the modifications we agreed on:

* Expanded **§4.1 Yogācāra** with *anātman*, Hindu contrast, diversity note.
* Expanded **§4.3 Indian Non-Buddhist Traditions** (Nyāya realism, Advaita intrinsicism).
* Revised **§5.2** with enactivism flagged as convergence.

---

## 3. Countertraditions Within the West

Although the dominant Western genealogy culminated in the codification of qualia as private, ineffable entities, countertraditions have consistently challenged this view. These critiques have often dissolved, rather than reinforced, the theater model of consciousness.

* **William James (1904): Radical Empiricism**
  James rejected the notion of consciousness as an inner arena populated by private objects. Instead, he proposed that “experience” is a continuous stream, composed of pure relational events. Consciousness is not an additional substance but a functional relation within experience. For James, talk of “intrinsic qualia” mistakes fluid experiential processes for discrete ontological atoms.

* **Husserl (1913/1983): Intentionality**
  Husserl’s phenomenology insisted that consciousness is always *consciousness of something*. Experiences are not private tokens but intentional acts, directed toward the world. Later phenomenologists, such as Merleau-Ponty (1945/2012), radicalized this into embodiment: perception is always situated in a bodily horizon, dissolving the mind–world dualism.

* **Sellars (1956/1997): The Myth of the Given**
  Sellars attacked the notion of “raw feels” as epistemically foundational. He argued that all perceptual content is conceptually mediated, embedded in what he called the “space of reasons.” To posit intrinsic, ineffable qualia is to fall into the “myth of the given.”

* **Ryle (1949): Category Mistakes**
  Ryle’s critique of the “ghost in the machine” exposed the category error in treating consciousness as a private theater separate from bodily behavior and public criteria. The very grammar of “inner objects” is misleading.

Despite these powerful critiques, analytic qualia realism remained dominant, in part because it aligned with the Cartesian–Lockean inheritance of privatized subjectivity. Countertraditions dissolved the theater but failed to displace it institutionally.

---

## 4. Cross-Cultural Counterpoints

The Western genealogy is not universal. Comparative traditions articulate alternative ontologies of appearance, where the notion of intrinsic qualia has no purchase. **These treatments are necessarily schematic**—given the vastness of each tradition—but suffice to show that the Western “private ineffable” framing is culturally particular.

### 4.1 Yogācāra Buddhism

Yogācāra developed a sophisticated model of consciousness organized into eight layers, culminating in the *ālaya-vijñāna* or storehouse consciousness. Appearances (*ākāra*) are experientially real but empty of intrinsic essence (*svabhāva*). They are dependently arisen projections, analogous to illusions (*māyā*). The goal of practice is not to reify experiences as private objects but to realize their emptiness. For Yogācāra, what analytic philosophers call “qualia” are merely projections that lose their grip through insight (Lusthaus, 2002; Schmithausen, 1987; Garfield, 2015).

This analysis is anchored in the broader Buddhist doctrine of **anātman (non-self)**, which denies any permanent, intrinsic essence either to persons or to mental phenomena. By contrast, Hindu traditions, especially **Advaita Vedānta**, affirm the existence of **ātman**—an enduring self or soul identical with ultimate reality (Brahman). This doctrinal divergence explains why Yogācāra accounts of consciousness resist positing intrinsic mental cores: experience is relational, processual, and ultimately empty. What Western analytic philosophy reifies as ineffable qualia, and what Hindu metaphysics secures in the *ātman*, Buddhism dissolves into dependent origination and non-self.

*Note on interpretive diversity:* Yogācāra is not monolithic. Early Indian formulations (Asaṅga, Vasubandhu) emphasized the *ālaya-vijñāna* as a karmic repository, with appearances understood as dependently arisen and empty of essence. Later East Asian interpretations (e.g., Faxiang, Huayan) sometimes leaned toward more ontological or “mind-only” readings, raising debates about whether Yogācāra amounts to a form of idealism (Makeham, 2018). Despite this diversity, none posit “qualia” in the analytic sense of private, ineffable mental atoms. The very variability of Yogācāra underscores the contingency of Western qualia realism: what is treated as universal and intrinsic in one intellectual lineage is absent, contested, or explicitly denied in another.

---

### 4.2 Chinese Traditions

* **Confucianism:** The concept of *xin* (heart–mind) emphasizes relationality and social embedding. Experience is not privatized but enacted through ritual and relational order.
* **Daoism / Zhuangzi:** Perceptual appearances are perspectival and variable; the butterfly dream parable underscores that no fixed essence grounds “what it’s like.” Experience shifts with standpoint, not with intrinsic qualia.

*Note: These sketches are necessarily selective; Ames & Hall (2001) offer deeper treatments.*

---

### 4.3 Indian Non-Buddhist Traditions

Indian philosophy developed parallel analyses of perception and consciousness that diverged sharply from Buddhist non-self views. Two traditions are especially instructive: **Nyāya realism** and **Advaita Vedānta**.

* **Nyāya Realism:** For Nyāya philosophers, perception (*pratyakṣa*) is direct contact with real objects. Consciousness is not a private theater populated by ineffable qualities but a reliable cognitive relation to external entities (Matilal, 1986; Chakrabarti, 1999). Nyāya rejects both Buddhist representationalism and the privatization of subjective appearances. Instead, perceptual episodes are epistemically veridical, embedded in a robust theory of pramāṇa (means of valid knowledge).

* **Advaita Vedānta:** Advaita takes the opposite stance, affirming that the apparent diversity of the world is *māyā*, illusory appearance veiling the ultimate unity of **Brahman**. Individual consciousness is not an ephemeral stream lacking essence, as in Buddhism, but the expression of a deeper, eternal **ātman** identical with Brahman. Where Yogācāra, grounded in the principle of **anātman**, denies intrinsic essence to both persons and appearances, Advaita metaphysics doubles down on intrinsicism: the ultimate self is real, immutable, and the ground of all phenomenality (Deutsch, 1973; Potter, 1981).

This juxtaposition highlights how the **Buddhist rejection of ātman**—and its corollary emphasis on dependent origination—directly explains the absence of qualia-like intuitions in Buddhist phenomenology. Meanwhile, Advaita’s insistence on *ātman/Brahman* as ultimate reality generates a framework much more congenial to “intrinsicist” intuitions. Both traditions thus illustrate that intuitions about the nature of experience are not universal givens but products of deep metaphysical commitments.

*Note:* These sketches are necessarily schematic and intended only to highlight contrasts relevant to the cultural-contingency thesis. Full exposition lies in the specialist literatures.

---

### 4.4 Islamic–Persian Traditions

* **Avicenna’s Flying Man:** The thought experiment demonstrates immediate self-awareness even in the absence of sensory input. Yet this awareness is not articulated in terms of private qualia but in terms of the soul’s self-presence.
* **Suhrawardī’s Illuminationism:** Consciousness is articulated as gradations of light, illuminating itself and others. Awareness is not ineffable “feels” but degrees of luminosity (Walbridge, 2000).

*Again, this sketch is selective: full exposition lies in specialist literatures.*

---

**Synthesis:** Across Yogācāra, Chinese, Indian, and Islamic traditions, appearances are understood relationally, cosmologically, or soteriologically. None posit private, ineffable qualia as intrinsic building blocks of experience. The very *intuition* of qualia realism appears culturally contingent.

---

## 5. Illusionism and Science

### 5.1 Illusionism

Contemporary illusionists such as Dennett (1991) and Frankish (2016) argue that qualia are introspective “user illusions”: constructed models of experience rather than intrinsic features. This converges with Yogācāra’s view that appearances lack intrinsic essence.

Yet there is divergence in aim:

* Illusionism aims to *deflate* metaphysical qualia.
* Yogācāra aims to *transform* experience soteriologically, reducing reification as a path to liberation.

The convergence demonstrates that qualia skepticism has both cross-cultural and scientific resonance.

---

### 5.2 Scientific Models of Consciousness

Modern cognitive science largely bypasses intrinsic qualia.

* **Enactivism (Maturana & Varela, 1991; Varela, Thompson, & Rosch, 1991; Thompson, 2007):** Consciousness is not the representation of intrinsic contents but the *enactment of a world* through embodied, situated interaction. Enactivism rejects the idea of qualia as inner mental atoms, treating experience as relational and processual. Importantly, this view resonates with Western **illusionism** (Dennett, Frankish) in denying intrinsic ineffables, and with **Yogācāra Buddhism**, which interprets appearances as dependently arisen and empty of essence. Varela and Thompson explicitly drew on Buddhist sources in developing enactivism, making it an unusual case where scientific theory, Western critique, and Buddhist phenomenology converge.

* **Global Workspace Theory (Baars, 1997; Dehaene, 2014):** Consciousness arises from information broadcasting across specialized modules. No appeal to ineffable qualia is needed.

* **Predictive Processing (Clark, 2013; Friston, 2018):** The brain is a generative model that minimizes prediction error. Phenomenology is modeled as inference, not intrinsic quality.

* **Integrated Information Theory (Tononi, 2008; Koch & Tononi, 2015):** Consciousness is identified with intrinsic causal structures. Uniquely, IIT reintroduces intrinsicist language, resonating with cultural pressures to preserve the intuition of ineffability.

Thus, most scientific theories deflate or bypass qualia, while IIT reflects the persistence of Western attractors toward intrinsicism.

---

## 6. Empirical Plausibility Arguments

The cultural-contingency hypothesis gains plausibility from empirical findings that show perception and introspection vary across populations and contexts. These are not proofs but suggestive footholds.

### 6.1 Cross-Cultural Perception

Empirical work in linguistic anthropology and psychology demonstrates that perceptual discriminations—often taken as paradigmatic “qualia”—vary across cultures.

Russian vs. English: Russian speakers, whose language distinguishes light and dark blue (*goluboy vs. siniy*), discriminate colors faster than English speakers (Winawer et al., 2007).

Himba: The Himba of Namibia categorize colors differently, perceiving contrasts that Western observers often miss (Roberson & Davidoff, 2000).

Japanese: Until the 20th century, the Japanese term *aoi* (青い) encompassed both blue and green. Even today, traffic lights are described as aoi, and grass or leafy vegetables may still be called aoi despite their green hue (Stanlaw, 2014; Hardin & Maffi, 1997). This suggests that distinctions such as “blue” vs. “green,” often assumed to mark basic qualia, are culturally contingent rather than natural givens.

Together, these findings indicate that what analytic philosophy has called “qualia” are not universally carved features of experience, but structured by language, culture, and social practice.

---

### 6.2 WEIRD Psychology

Henrich, Heine, & Norenzayan (2010) demonstrate that Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, and Democratic populations are outliers in perceptual and cognitive tasks. The assumption that qualia intuitions are universal ignores the cultural specificity of the populations that produced them.

---

### 6.3 Meditation Studies

Neuroscientific studies show that contemplative practices reduce reification and subject–object dualism (Lutz et al., 2007; Lindahl et al., 2017). This suggests phenomenology itself is mutable: the grip of intrinsicist intuitions can be loosened through training.

---

### 6.4 Corpus Analysis

Historical studies show the gradual rise of “inner experience” vocabulary in early modern Europe (Burnyeat, 1990; Taylor, 1989). Language reflects cultural shifts in how consciousness is conceptualized.

---

**Caveat:** These are plausibility arguments, not proofs. But together, they support the claim that qualia intuitions are not universal givens but contingent constructs shaped by culture, language, and training.

---
Excellent. Here’s **Part III of the rewritten ArXiv master paper** — the final section, incorporating all the modifications we discussed:

* **§7 Corollary 1** (contemplative practice as debiasing).
* **§7.1 Enactivism as a Bridge** (new, emphasizing triple convergence).
* **§8 Comparative Synthesis** (streamlined, no table, enactivism mentioned briefly).
* **§9 Conclusion** (with methodological payoff sharpened).
* **Appendix A** (expanded AI corollary).
* **References** (complete, consolidated with additions).

# Part III

## 7. Corollary 1: Yogācāra and Shedding Cultural Bias

If the genealogy of qualia realism is parochial rather than universal, then one implication is methodological: *can philosophical intuitions themselves be reshaped?*

## 7.1 Yogācāra as Method

Yogācāra Buddhism answers in the affirmative. Its emphasis on training consciousness through meditation shows that phenomenology is not fixed but malleable. Practices such as mindfulness and analytical meditation explicitly aim to reduce reification—the tendency to treat appearances as intrinsic, self-existing entities.

Modern contemplative science corroborates this. Neurophenomenological research indicates that sustained meditation practice alters attentional styles, weakens the sense of subject–object dualism, and reduces the conviction in “raw feel” intuitions (Lutz et al., 2007; Lindahl et al., 2017).

This suggests a methodological corollary: **contemplative practices can serve as experimental tools to shed cultural bias in consciousness studies.** By weakening intrinsicist intuitions, they can recalibrate philosophical reflection and provide comparative baselines for empirical psychology.

Philosophy of mind, in this light, should not merely analyze intuitions but actively test and transform them, in the spirit of experimental philosophy enriched by contemplative science.


---

## 7.1 Enactivism as a Bridge

Enactivism offers a striking example of how comparative philosophy and contemplative practice have already shaped cognitive science. Varela, Thompson, and Rosch (1991) explicitly engaged with Buddhist thought in *The Embodied Mind*, using Yogācāra and phenomenological insights to reframe cognitive science around embodiment and world-enactment. Thompson (2007) further develops this dialogue, integrating phenomenology, biology, and Yogācāra philosophy into a coherent research program.

From a cultural-contingency perspective, enactivism exemplifies a **triple convergence**:

* **Western illusionism:** Qualia are “user illusions,” not intrinsic essences.
* **Buddhist Yogācāra:** Appearances are projections, empty of *svabhāva*.
* **Cognitive science:** Consciousness is enacted through organism–environment coupling.

This convergence demonstrates that one can build a viable, empirically grounded science of consciousness while denying intrinsic qualia. It also illustrates the methodological payoff: comparative philosophy is not merely ornamental but has already shaped modern cognitive science. The enactivist project shows how Western and Buddhist critiques of qualia realism can be operationalized in scientific models, reinforcing the case that intrinsicist qualia are culturally contingent rather than universal.

---

## 8. Comparative Synthesis

The argument can now be summarized across genealogy, comparative traditions, science, and methodology:

* **Western Genealogy:** From Aristotle’s forms, Plato’s suspicion of appearances, Descartes’ *res cogitans*, Locke’s secondary qualities, to analytic crystallization, the West progressively privatized and reified experience as intrinsic qualia.
* **Western Countertraditions:** Figures such as James, Husserl, Merleau-Ponty, Sellars, and Ryle sought to dissolve the theater model, but their critiques did not dislodge or dissolve the mainstream view.
* **Cross-Cultural Traditions:** Yogācāra Buddhism, Chinese *xin* and perspectivalism, Nyāya realism, Advaita Vedānta’s metaphysical intrinsicism, and Islamic–Persian accounts of illumination all articulate consciousness in ways that resist or invert Western qualia realism. Appearances are relational, cosmological, or soteriological, but not ineffable atoms of private subjectivity.
* **Science:** Most cognitive theories (enactivism, GNW, predictive processing) deflate qualia; IIT is an intrinsicist outlier, reflecting cultural attractors and instriscist vocabulary.
* **Illusionism & Yogācāra:** Converge on denying intrinsic essence, though for different reasons (deflation vs. transformation).
* **Enactivism:** A contemporary bridge uniting Western critique, Buddhist philosophy, and scientific practice.
* **Empirical Footholds:** Cross-cultural perception, WEIRD psychology, meditation, and historical corpus analysis make the cultural-contingency thesis plausible.
* Methodological Corollaries:

  * §7.1 Yogācāra as Method: Contemplative practices can be employed as tools to weaken intrinsicist intuitions and shed cultural bias.

  * §7.2 Enactivism as a Bridge: The very existence of enactivism shows how Buddhist philosophy, Western illusionism, and cognitive science converge in denying intrinsic qualia and developing relational models.

Taken together, these strands support the central thesis: ** qualia realism and the hard problem are not timeless universals but cultural artifacts. ** What Western philosophy treats as metaphysical givens are revealed, in cross-cultural and scientific perspective, as contingent constructs.

The synthesis supports the claim that qualia realism and the hard problem are not timeless universals but cultural artifacts.

---

## 9. Conclusion

Qualia realism and the hard problem emerge from a specific Western genealogy, not from the nature of consciousness itself. Comparative traditions reveal radically different conceptualizations of appearance, and empirical evidence suggests that intuitions about phenomenality are historically and culturally contingent.

**Philosophical payoff:** The methodological consequence is clear: **philosophy of mind should no longer treat qualia intuitions as universal evidence. They must be tested cross-culturally and historically, with empirical psychology and contemplative science as partners.**

This reframing transforms the hard problem from an intractable metaphysical puzzle into a culturally parochial artifact.

Two corollaries follow:

1. Yogācāra-inspired contemplative practices may help shed cultural bias and recalibrate intuitions.
2. Artificial intelligence may benefit from “qualia-like” generating modules—functional proxies that simulate introspective features without metaphysical commitments.

Together, these claims motivate a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness—one that recognizes the cultural contingency of qualia, reframes the hard problem, and explores new horizons in both philosophy and AI.

* ** The hard problem is not a metaphysical mystery of nature but a cultural artifact of Western subjectivism. ** *

Together, these claims motivate a more pluralistic, interdisciplinary science of consciousness—one that recognizes the cultural contingency of qualia, reframes the hard problem, and opens new directions in philosophy, psychology, and AI.

---

# Appendix A. Corollary 2: Expanded AI Implications

### A.1 Rationale

If qualia are cultural constructs rather than metaphysical givens, they may nonetheless have *functional analogues*. In human cognition, the appearance of intrinsic “raw feels” may serve as heuristics for self-monitoring, error detection, and communication. Artificial intelligence systems, though not conscious in any metaphysical sense, may benefit from analogous mechanisms.

Thus, we can propose **qualia-like generators**: computational modules that produce structured, internally coherent representational states optimized for reportability and introspection-like outputs.

---

### A.2 Connection to World-Model AI

Current advances in world-model architectures emphasize abstract representation over raw reconstruction:

* **JEPA (Joint Embedding Predictive Architecture):** learns abstract predictive states rather than pixels (LeCun, 2022).
* **I-JEPA (Assran et al., 2023):** self-supervised representation learning from images.
* **V-JEPA (Bardes et al., 2024):** predictive representation learning from video.

These architectures generate latent world-model states. But they lack *introspective proxies*: layers trained not for external prediction but for *self-description* and report.

---

### A.3 Phenomenal Proxies

I propose augmenting world-models with **phenomenal proxy layers**:

* **Structured latent states** optimized for reportability (e.g., “what it seems like” to the system).
* **Auxiliary heads** trained to produce confidence ratings, counterfactual perception reports, and susceptibility to perceptual illusions.
* **Culturally tunable priors** that allow introspective outputs to vary depending on linguistic and cultural framing.

These proxies do not instantiate consciousness but functionally mimic aspects of introspection.

---

### A.4 Evaluation Benchmarks

Testing qualia-like modules would require new benchmarks:

1. **Illusion Reproduction:** Can the system replicate human-like responses to perceptual illusions?
2. **Introspective Calibration:** Can it generate self-assessments of confidence aligned with error rates?
3. **Cultural Toggling:** Can it shift perceptual categorization or introspective vocabulary depending on cultural priors (e.g., Russian vs. English blue distinctions)?

These benchmarks provide engineering heuristics inspired by consciousness science without making metaphysical claims.

---

### A.5 Comparative Philosophy as Design Heuristics

Comparative traditions offer unexpected inspiration:

* **Yogācāra:** Illusion-like phenomenology → design for introspective debiasing.
* **Chinese perspectivalism:** Multiple standpoints → model cultural toggling.
* **Advaita:** Illusory appearance over absolute reality → functional layers masking latent states.
* **Suhrawardī:** Gradations of light → continuous measures of introspective confidence.

These conceptual resources highlight possible design spaces for AI introspection.

---

### A.6 Status and Outlook

This proposal is speculative but programmatic. By reinterpreting qualia as cultural artifacts, we can reimagine them as **engineering heuristics** rather than metaphysical mysteries. Qualia-like modules may enrich AI world-models with self-report layers, producing systems that can communicate internal states in ways legible to human collaborators.

This interdisciplinary bridge invites future research across philosophy of mind, cognitive science, and AI engineering.
